# Import saved places to Google Maps

This is a dumb script to read a CSV file (presumably from Google Takeout) and import all the saved places in the CSV
file into Google Maps. This effectively lets you migrate saved places from one Google account to another, which Google
does not currently support out of the box.

There are lots of hacks and shortcuts in this script because I just wrote it to work for myself, but I thought it could
be useful for other folks. Feel free to contribute and make it more reusable if you want.
